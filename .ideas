## When no account name is specified, generate a random name
Afterwards the user can find their new account by entering their public key in a block explorer like bloks.io.

## When launching, add a countdown that gives the first xxx users free accounts
For example the first 100 users to create new accounts get their account for free, i.e. RAM is paid for by the contract. (how to prevent abuse?)

## Develop frontend for contract
That shows step-by-step instructions, "generates" the memo etc. Also shows the number of free accounts left (see above), and the current cost of an account (and thus minimum EOS required to send).
